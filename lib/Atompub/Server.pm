=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Atompub::Server> provides a base class for Atom Publishing Protocol servers.
It handles all core server processing, and Basic and WSSE authentication.
It can also run as either a mod_perl handler or as part of a CGI program.

It does not provide functions specific to any particular implementation,
such as creating an entry, retrieving a list of entries, deleting an entry, etc.
Implementations should subclass B<Atompub::Server>, overriding the
C<handle_request> method, and handle all functions such as this themselves.

B<Atompub::Server> extends B<Atom::XML::Server>, and basically provides same functions.
However, this module has been fixed based on the Atom Publishing Protocol
described at L<http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-17.txt>,
and supports Basic authentication rather than WSSE.

This module was tested in InteropTokyo2007
L<http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/July2007InteropTokyo>,
and interoperated with other implementations.


=head1 SUBCLASSING

=head2 Request Handling

Subclasses of B<Atompub::Server> must override the C<handle_request>
method to perform all request processing.
The implementation must set all response headers, including the response
code and any relevant HTTP headers, and should return a scalar representing 
the response body to be sent back to the client.

For example:

    sub handle_request {
        my $server = shift;
        my $method = $server->request_method;
        if ( $method eq 'POST' ) {
            return $server->new_post;
        }
        ## ... handle GET, PUT, etc
    }

    sub new_post {
        my $server = shift;
        my $entry = $server->atom_body || return;

        ## Implementation-specific
        my $id = save_this_entry( $entry );
        my $location = join '/', $server->uri, $id;
	my $etag = calc_etag( $entry );

        $server->response_header(
            Location          => $location,
           'Content-Location' => $location,
            ETag              => $etag,
        );
        $server->response_code( RC_CREATED );
        $server->response_content_type( 'application/atom+xml;type=entry' );

	## Implementation-specific
        return serialize_entry( $entry );
    }

=head2 Authentication

Servers that require authentication should override the C<password_for_user> method.
Given a username (from the Authorization or WSSE header),
C<password_for_user> should return that user's password in plaintext.
If the supplied username doesn't exist in your user database or alike,
just return C<undef>.

For example:

    my %Passwords = ( foo => 'bar' );   ## The password for "foo" is "bar".
    sub password_for_user {
        my $server = shift;
        my ( $username ) = @_;
        $Passwords{$username};
    }

=over 2

=item * Basic Authentication

I<realm> must be assigned before authentication for Basic authentication.

    $server->realm('MySite');

If your server runs as a CGI program and authenticates by Basic authenticate,
you should use authentication mechanism of the http server, like C<.htaccess>.

=item * WSSE Authentication

Any pre-configuration is not required for WSSE.
The password returned from C<password_for_user> will be combined with the nonce
and the creation time to generate the digest, which will be compared
with the digest sent in the WSSE header.

=head1 METHODS

B<Atompub::Server> provides a variety of methods to be used by subclasses
for retrieving headers, content, and other request information, and for
setting the same on the response.

=head2 $server->realm

If called with an argument, sets the I<realm> for Basic authentication.

Returns the current I<realm> that will be used when receiving requests.

=head2 $server->send_http_header( $content_type )

=head2 $server->get_auth_info

=head2 $server->authenticate

=head2 $server->auth_failure( $status, $message )

=head2 oether methods

Descriptions are found in L<XML::Atom::Server>.


=head1 USAGE

Once you have defined your server subclass, you can set it up either as a
CGI program or as a mod_perl handler.

See L<XML::Atom::Server> in details.
